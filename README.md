# Description

This contains the code and files for my personal website ([jdleongomez.info](https://jdleongomez.info/)), created using the [Wowchemy Website Builder](https://wowchemy.com/) for Hugo. If you are interested, you can [check it](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/), or clone my [personal website repository](https://github.com/JDLeongomez/JDL_website).

This website is nothing new, but it is a working multilingual example ([English](https://jdleongomez.info/) and [Spanish](https://jdleongomez.info/es/)). Latest deploy status: [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/56cad952-dba4-4d8c-ad1c-16a0c1e43c4a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/jdleongomez/deploys).
