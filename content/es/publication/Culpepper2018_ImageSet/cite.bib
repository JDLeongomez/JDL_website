  abstract = {The Culpepper Disgust Image Set (C-DIS; Culpepper et al., 2018) consists of 20 pathogen-salient and 20 pathogen-free images which can be used to assess disgust in experimental settings (through the presentation of the pathogen-salient set of images) and to measure individual variability in disgust sensitivity (by viewing both the pathogen-salient and pathogen-free images). Developed within the context of shedding light on disease-avoidance processes and for the purpose of providing a reliable alternative to Curtis, Aunger, \& Rabie's (2004) images of disease-salient stimuli, measure construction employed a multi-stage, bottom-up item-generation process that sought to determine the most widespread and effective elicitors of disgust across several cultures (English, Czech, and Spanish speakers). Psychometric evaluation of the final version of C-DIS was conducted via online survey with participants responding from 19 countries. Findings detailing the measure's factor structure, internal consistency, and convergent validity were presented. Demographic characteristics of the online sample and decisions made regarding item distinctiveness were discussed as possible limiting factors.
