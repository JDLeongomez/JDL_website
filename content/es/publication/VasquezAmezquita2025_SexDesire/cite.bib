  abstract = {It is unclear whether trait sexual desire (TSD) is related to the subjective sexual arousal (SSA) to erotic stimuli, and whether this relationship varies by gender and is dependent on the dimension of TSD, the preferred sexual stimulus, and contextual variables such as relationship status. We tested these hypotheses in 323 cisgender participants, 139 gynephilic men and 184 androphilic women, who anonymously assessed their TSD levels and rated their SSA while individually viewing erotic and non-erotic stimuli depicting both sexes. We found a positive predictive relationship between TSD (solitary and toward an attractive person) and SSA in both men and women, independent of relationship status. The relationship between TSD toward an attractive person and SSA was gender-specific in men and gender-nonspecific in women. Likewise, we found that gender differences in all three dimensions of TSD and in the predictive relationship between TSD toward a partner and SSA were qualified by relationship status specifically toward erotic stimuli, increasing gender differences in all three dimensions, and mainly affecting women&#39;s response. We conclude that TSD affects SSA, and that TSD appears to be dynamic and context-dependent in nature.},
