abstract = {Sexual fantasies (SF) are an integral part of human sexuality. In contrast with sexual behavioural displays, which rely to great extend on social factors, they are ideal for studying cognitive adaptations related to sexual differences in mate preferences and motivations. This article examines sex differences in the incidence of sexual fantasies highlighting evolutionary relevant objects across the sample of university students currently involved in long-term relationship (142 women and 121 men). In addition, the intentions to perform sexual activities with these objects were observed. Objects in the checklist of SF (10) were chosen based on evolutionary-psychological literature (e.g., stranger, same sex partner, multiple partner, and inexperienced partner) and were reflected assuming reproductive strategies of both sexes. Supporting evolutionary assumptions, men fantasised more about partners who provide the possibility of increasing fitness with low investment (e.g., multiple partners of opposite sex, $\chi$2 = 19.90, P {\textless} 0.001), and displaying characteristics indicating fertility and youth (much younger partners $\chi$2 = 18.60, P {\textless} 0.001). Women, in contrast, were more likely to fantasise and perform sexual activities with another woman ($\chi$2 = 17.04, P {\textless} 0.001), which is in accordance with recent studies highlighting the plasticity of female sexuality. The evolutionary advantageousness of such sexual activities, however, is debatable. Notably, we found similar patterns in SF incidence and intentions to perform activities with chosen objects, making this study one of the first to prove such phenomena. Based on the results, we suggest that SF highlighting objects represent desired sexual activities that may not be performed because of the existence of social pressure, cultural rules and/or unavailability of (consensual) sexual partner.},
