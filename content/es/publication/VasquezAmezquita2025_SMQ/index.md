# Abstract.
abstract = "This study aimed to translate, adapt, and evaluate the preliminary psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Sexual Modes Questionnaire (SMQ; Nobre & Pinto-Gouveia, 2003), focusing on negative automatic thoughts during sexual activity. A total of 521 Colombian participants were recruited through psychology students, and social media posts. The final sample consisted of 338 heterosexual cisgender adults (149 men, 189 women) aged 18–40 years (M = 25.76, SD = 4.9). The validity of the internal structure was explored through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), internal consistency and reliability were assessed using Cronbach's alpha (α), McDonald's omega (ω), and item-test correlation. Convergent validity was evaluated by correlating the scale with state and trait affect and subjective sexual functioning. Results provide preliminary evidence of good internal consistency, reliability, and convergent validity for both male and female versions of the SMQ. This adaptation is the first to validate the SMQ in a Spanish-speaking sample, expanding cross-cultural evidence on cognitive-affective mechanisms underlying sexual dysfunction. Findings underscore its potential utility in research and clinical practice for assessing automatic thoughts during sexual activity in Latin American contexts"
