  abstract = {The Sexual Modes Questionnaire (SMQ) assesses negative automatic thoughts during sexual activity and is widely used to understand cognitive-affective mechanisms related to sexual dysfunctions. However, it had not been adapted or validated for Spanish-speaking populations. This study aimed to translate, culturally adapt, and evaluate the psychometric properties of the SMQ in a Colombian sample. The SMQ was translated and adapted using standard procedures. The final sample consisted of 338 heterosexual cisgender adults (149 men, 189 women) aged 18–40 years (M = 25.76, SD = 4.9). Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was used to explore internal structure. Reliability was assessed through Cronbach’s alpha, McDonald’s omega, and item-test correlations. Convergent validity was evaluated using measures of affect and sexual functioning. The adapted SMQ showed a factor structure consistent with the original, with good internal consistency and acceptable item-test correlations. Convergent validity was supported through significant associations with affective and sexual functioning variables. This is the first validated Spanish version of the SMQ. Findings support its use in clinical and research contexts to assess automatic thoughts during sexual activity in Latin American populations. This study translated, adapted, and validated the Sexual Modes Questionnaire (SMQ) in a Colombian sample. Results showed good reliability, validity, and a factor structure consistent with the original. This is the first Spanish version of the SMQ, providing a useful tool for assessing automatic thoughts during sexual activity in Latin America.},
