  abstract = {Women's preferences for facial masculinity in men are influenced by individual and socio-contextual factors that help balance costs-benefits in pursuit of well-being. This study explored how Colombian women's preferences for masculinized male faces are influenced by relationship context and resource availability, as well as their individual experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV). Using a forced-choice paradigm with eye-tracking, we assessed visual attention and face-choice in 293 cisgender heterosexual Colombian women recruited through social media adverts. Participants were assigned to either a high or low resource availability condition and selected preferred partners for short- and long-term relationships. Self-reported IPV experiences were also collected. Results revealed a strong preference for masculine faces in both relationship contexts, with higher preference in long-term scenarios and under low resource availability. However, higher frequencies of physical IPV predicted a lower preference for masculinity, particularly in long-term and high-resource contexts. These exploratory findings suggest that while Colombian women generally favor masculine traits, socio-contextual factors, such as resource availability and IPV experiences, significantly modulate these preferences. The study highlights the complex interplay between individual, evolutionary, and socio-ecological factors in shaping mate preferences, suggesting that masculinity is valued depending on relationship goals, resource conditions, and individual experiences like IPV.},
