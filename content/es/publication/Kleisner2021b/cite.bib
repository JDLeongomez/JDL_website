  abstract = {The human voice carries information about a vocaliser's physical strength that listeners can perceive, and that may influence mate choice and intrasexual competition. Yet, reliable acoustic correlates of strength in human speech remain unknown. Compared to speech, aggressive nonverbal vocalisations (`roars') may function to maximise perceived strength, suggesting that their acoustic structure has been selected to communicate formidability, similar to the vocal threat displays of other animals. Here, we test whether vocal signals of strength are maximised in roars compared to speech in two non-WEIRD African samples: an urban community of Cameroonians and rural nomadic Hadza hunter-gatherers in the Tanzanian bushlands. Participants were audio recorded producing standardised speech and volitional roars; their handgrip strength was measured with a hand dynamometer. Using acoustic analysis and informationtheoretic multi-model inference and averaging techniques, we show that roars predict 40-70\% of the variance in actual strength in African men and women, and several times more variance than do vowels, words or phrases. However, strength is predicted by multiple acoustic parameters whose combinations vary by sex, sample and vocal type. Thus, while roars may maximally signal strength, more research is needed to uncover consistent and likely interacting acoustic correlates of strength in the human voice.},
