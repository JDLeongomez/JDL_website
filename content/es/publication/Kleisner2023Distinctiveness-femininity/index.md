# Abstract.
abstract = "Studies investigating facial attractiveness in humans have frequently been limited to studying the effect of individual factors in isolation from other facial components in the same population. In this study we go beyond this approach by combining geometric morphometrics and a Bayesian statistical framework. We investigate preferences in both sexes for three structural components of facial beauty that are traditionally considered indicators of biological quality: symmetry, sexual dimorphism, and distinctiveness. Based on a large sample of faces (n=1550) from 10 populations across the world (Brazil, Cameroon, Czechia, Colombia, India, Namibia, Romania, Turkey, UK, and Vietnam), we found that distinctiveness negatively affects the perception of attractiveness in both sexes and that this association is stable across all studied populations. We corroborated some previous results indicating both a positive effect of femininity on female facial beauty and a null or weak effect of masculinity on male facial attractiveness. Surprisingly, facial symmetry had no effect on facial attractiveness. In concert with other recent studies, our results support the importance of facial prototypicality but cast doubt on the role of symmetry as one of the key constituents of attractiveness in the human face."
