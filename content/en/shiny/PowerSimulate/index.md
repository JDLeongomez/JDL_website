[PowerSimulate](https://shiny.jdl-svr.lat/PowerSimulate/) is a collection of compact R Shiny applications designed to perform simulation-based statistical power analysis. 

Although there are more straightforward tools for power analysis in simple tests such as correlations, t-tests and ANOVA, these applications are based exclusively on simulations. They serve as an educational tool to demonstrate the concept of statistical power, but also as a platform to show the importance of simulation-based power analysis for more complex designs.

All applications are available on my (rather slow) [Shiny personal server](https://shiny.jdl-svr.lat/PowerSimulate/). However, if it runs too slow or my server doesn't work, you can always run it locally on your computer with R installed. Just open the link to the code on GitHub, and you'll find instructions there.
