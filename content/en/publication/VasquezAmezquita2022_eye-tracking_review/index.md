# Abstract.
abstract = "Attention plays a central role in current theories about the processing of sexual information. Attention paradigms, such as eye tracking, have been used to study sexual preferences for men (androphilia) or women (gynephilia). More recently, eye tracking has also been used to study the atypical sexual preference of pedophilia, which represents sexual attraction to prepubescent children. The aim of this review is to apply a conceptual model of attentional processing in sexual response, the information processing model, and show how eye-tracking is a useful indirect measure of both typical sexual preferences such as androphilia and gynephilia and atypical preferences such as pedophilia. Implications for research are discussed in terms of recognizing the value, scope, and limitations of eye-tracking paradigms in the study of pedophilia, and hypothesis generation using this type of indirect measures of human sexual response.
