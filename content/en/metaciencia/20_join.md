<strong>Meta<span class='mc-ink'>Ciencia</span></strong> brings together people from different academic backgrounds, including:

- **Undergraduate and graduate students** from Universidad El Bosque and other universities.  
- **Faculty members** interested in open science, replication, innovative teaching, and metascience.  
- No previous research experience is required — just curiosity and an interest in science, philosophy, design, statistics, programming, or related areas.
