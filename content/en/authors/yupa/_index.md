PhD candidate in Psychology at Universidad de los Andes. He holds an MSc in Social Neuroscience from Universidad Externado de Colombia and a Bachelor’s degree in Music from Universidad del Valle. His academic interests focus on social interactions mediated by nonverbal communication—particularly prosody—and their impact on prosocial relationships.  

His current research examines how the prosodic features of informal caregivers of people with Alzheimer’s disease may influence the perceived quality of care and the caregivers’ own well-being. He also works as an independent corporate consultant and, outside academia, enjoys singing with his salsa orchestra, swimming, running, travelling, and spending time with his family.
