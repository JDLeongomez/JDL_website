I am an Associate Professor and Researcher at the [Human Behaviour Lab (LACH)](https://sites.google.com/unbosque.edu.co/lach-es/home), [Faculty of Psychology](https://www.uelbosque.edu.co/psicologia), at [Universidad El Bosque](https://www.uelbosque.edu.co/) in Bogota, Colombia. My research interests include mate choice and human vocal communication, with an aspiration towards understanding musicality. I am also interested in bioacoustics and psychoacoustics, as well as hormonal effects on human behaviour. I am getting more and more passionate about quantitative methods and R programming, to promote reproducibility and open science.

## [Investigaci贸n Abierta](#posts) (YouTube channel)

Investigaci贸n Abierta is a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs-6iLG3cnZwtGFcvyObPpA) (in Spanish) where I sometimes post videos and tutorials related to quantitative research methods and open science, as well as useful open source software. You can find information in English about the videos [here](#posts).
