I am an Associate Professor and Researcher at [***EvoCo**: Human Behaviour and Evolution Lab*](/en/team/), in the [Faculty of Psychology](https://www.unbosque.edu.co/psicologia) at [Universidad El Bosque](https://www.unbosque.edu.co/) in Bogota, Colombia. Aditionally, I lead the [***CODEC**: Cognitive and Behavioural Sciences*](https://unbosque.portalinvestigacion.com/grupos/302) research group (classified as [A1](https://scienti.minciencias.gov.co/gruplac/jsp/visualiza/visualizagr.jsp?nro=00000000001446)).

I am also a founding and board member of the ***Latin American Association for Human Behavioral and Evolutionary Sciences*** (***LAAHBES***) and serve as  [recommender](https://rr.peercommunityin.org/about/recommenders) (equivalent to journal Associate Editor) for [***PCI Registered Reports***](https://rr.peercommunityin.org/), and as [Data Editor](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rspb/pages/Editorial_Board) for [***Proceedings of the Royal Society B***](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rspb).

My research primarily focuses on human vocal communication, mate choice, and musicality, as well as bioacoustics, psychoacoustics, and hormonal effects on human behaviour. I have published some of the first articles demonstrating within-individual changes in voice pitch in response to the social status of the listener, as well as the significant effects of voice modulation on listeners in courtship contexts.  

I am also passionate about quantitative methods and [<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)&nbsp;programming, and advocate for reproducibility and open science. In this spirit, I initiated [Meta<strong>Ciencia</strong>](/en/metaciencia/), a student research incubator aimed at critically exploring how science is conducted and at training students and faculty in open, collaborative, and reproducible practices.

## [Investigación Abierta](#posts) (YouTube channel)

Investigación Abierta ["*Open Research*"] is a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@InvestigacionAbierta) in Spanish where I sometimes post videos and tutorials related to quantitative research methods and open science, as well as useful open source software. You can find information in English about the channel and video series [here](/en/post/).
