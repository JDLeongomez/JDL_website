Jan is an important collaborator to my doctoral supervisor [S. Craig Roberts](/ es / author / s.-craig-roberts /), who became an important contributor to my doctoral research. We have worked on several projects and publications, mainly related to vocal and facial signals and their effects on the choice of a mate in humans. For more information and to see his work and publications, visit [his profile](https://etologiecloveka.cz/index.php/en/people/jan-havlicek/), and the page of the [Human Ethology](https://etologiecloveka.cz/index.php/en/) research group (Faculty of Science, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic).
