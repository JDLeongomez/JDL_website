Lina is a psychologist from the [Universidad de La Sabana](https://www.unisabana.edu.co/) and a Master's in Psychology for Organizations: Human Resources, Marketing and Communication from the [Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore](https://www.unicatt.it/). I was her professor in inferential statistics and in a seminar on vocal communication at the [Universidad de La Sabana](https://www.unisabana.edu.co/) between 2015 and 2016, while she was doing her undergraduate degree.

After completing her master's degree and returning to Colombia, Lina voluntarily joined the [Human Behavior Analysis Laboratory (EvoCo)](/en/team/) in 2020, where she has been training in research methods, data analysis and programming in R, and has supported research processes as a research assistant under my supervision.
