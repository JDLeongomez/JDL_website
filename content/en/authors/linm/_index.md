Lina is a psychologist from the [Universidad de La Sabana](https://www.unisabana.edu.co/), where I was her lecturer in statistics and in a seminar on the evolution of vocal communication. In 2020, she joined [***EvoCo**: Laboratorio de Evolución y Comportamiento Humano*](/en/team/) as a volunteer, where she began training in research methods, data analysis, and programming in R, and has supported several research projects as a research assistant.

In 2023, she completed the MSc in Psychology of the Arts and Neuroaesthetics at [Goldsmiths, University of London](https://www.gold.ac.uk) (London, United Kingdom). She is currently pursuing a PhD in Cognition and Human Evolution at the [Universidad de las Islas Baleares](https://www.uib.es) (Spain).

## **Research**

Lina is interested in intercultural and interdisciplinary initiatives that integrate art and science as tools for interpersonal connection.

Her research focuses on exploring how people coordinate and communicate through movement and dance, and on understanding how individual and cultural factors shape this experience at both aesthetic and social levels, with a particular emphasis on neuroaesthetics.
