Chris is a friend and collaborator. For more information and to see his work and publications, visit his [lab website](https://www.relationship-lab.com/), or his [university page](https://www.abertay.ac.uk/staff-search/dr-christopher-watkins/).

I worked with him on a project related to environmental predictors of mouth-to-mouth kissing:

Happily, for this project lead by Chris, we were awarded the 2020 [Ig Nobel Prize](https://www.improbable.com/ig-about/) on economics, "[for trying to quantify the relationship between different countriesâ€™ national income inequality and the average amount of mouth-to-mouth kissing](https://www.improbable.com/ig-about/winners/#ig2020)". Below, you can watch the ceremony (if you want to jump to Chris receiving the price, go to [28:13](https://youtu.be/Amkyp-dhYX0?t=1693)).
