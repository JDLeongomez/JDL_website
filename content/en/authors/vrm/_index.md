I met Vicky in 2010 when we both started our doctoral studies at the [University of Stirling](http://www.stir.ac.uk/). Since the beginning we have maintained a great friendship and have collaborated and published several articles. In 2015, she visited Bogotá with her family, travelling around the city, and even giving a great talk. For more information and to see her work and publications, visit her [Stirling University page](https://www.stir.ac.uk/people/256768).
